If java has permission issues try cp -r on server folder on windows

start file should be named launch.sh

remove any pause logic at the end of launch.sh, start_server.sh will handle the restart loop

add .env file with following params
SERVER_PATH [string] (required)
    path to server folder w.r.t. docker-compose.yml.
    e.g. if the .yml file and server are in the same directory this should be SERVER_PATH=./divine-journey-2
RESTART_CONTAINER_ON_STOP [1,0] (optional, default 1)
    if 1 this will allow the server script to exit (shutting down the container) on a server stop.
    restart is set to 'unless-stopped' in the docker-compose so the container will come back up.
    if 0 (or anything besides 1) this will cause the script to restart the server itself without bringing the container down
