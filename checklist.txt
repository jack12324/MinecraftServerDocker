If java has permission issues try cp -r on server folder on windows

start file should be named launch.sh

remove any pause logic at the end of launch.sh, start_server.sh will handle the restart loop

add .env file with following params
SERVER_PATH path to server folder w.r.t. docker-compose.yml.
    e.g. if the .yml file and server are in the same directory this should be SERVER_PATH=./divine-journey-2
